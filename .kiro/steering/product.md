# Product Overview

**Wedding & Events OS (WedX)** is a unified, AI-driven planning platform engineered specifically for the Sri Lankan market, bridging high-stress cultural expectations with modern digital convenience.

## Core Capabilities

- **Cultural Wizard**: Automates multi-event flows (Engagement, Poruwa, Homecoming) with ritual injection (Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian).
- **Smart Planning Modules**: Master checklists, specialized Jewelry Module (inventory/rentals), and Guest Lists with partitioned quotas.
- **Hybrid Vendor Marketplace**: Connects high-tech users with low-tech vendors via a "WhatsApp Bridge" and partner profiles.
- **Day-Of & Timeline**: Offline-first timeline management and contact sync.
- **AI Orchestration**: "Nano Banana" (Image Gen) for visualization and automated Conflict Detection for scheduling.

## Target Use Cases

- **Local & Diaspora Couples**: Planning complex, multi-day traditional weddings with remote coordination needs.
- **Parental Involvement**: Managing guest quotas, rituals, and reputation sensitive tasks.
- **Vendor Coordination**: Bridging communication gaps between digital-native couples and traditional service providers.

## Value Proposition

- **Cultural Nativity**: Native handling of auspicious times ("Nakath"), complex rituals, and multi-day event structures.
- **Hybrid Bridge**: Enables seamless interaction with vendors who rely solely on WhatsApp, without forcing them onto a new platform.
- **Centralized OS**: A single source of truth for couples, parents, and vendors, reducing friction and miscommunication.
