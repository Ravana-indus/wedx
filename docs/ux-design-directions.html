    <h1>wedX – UX Design Directions</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      High-level layout and interaction directions for the core wedX web app.
      These act as reference frames for designers implementing high-fidelity
      mockups.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Direction 1 – Wizard-First OS</h2>
        <p class="meta">
          Full-screen, low-chrome wizard for first-time setup, followed by a
          structured dashboard.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First session: 5-step cultural wizard (type, events, vibe, rituals,
            plan).
          </li>
          <li>
            After completion: redirect to “Today” dashboard with tasks seeded
            from wizard outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideal when couples are overwhelmed and need strong guidance before
            seeing a dense UI.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Direction 2 – Three-Column Control Room</h2>
        <p class="meta">
          Desktop experience that feels like a calm control room rather than a
          generic admin panel.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Left: vertical navigation with Today, Checklist, Events, Guests,
            Vendors, Budget, AI Planner, Inspiration, Settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Center: primary content (Today’s tasks, event timeline, checklists).
          </li>
          <li>
            Right: AI Planner, vendor conversations, and inspiration strip.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mirrors mental model from ride-hailing and fintech apps: core
            actions central, assistance on the side.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Direction 3 – Vendor & WhatsApp Bridge Hub</h2>
        <p class="meta">
          Focused flows and layouts for combining partner vendors with
          WhatsApp-based vendors.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two-core tabs: “Find vendors” (partner marketplace) and “My vendors”
            (booked/shortlisted + WhatsApp leads).
          </li>
          <li>
            WhatsApp flows: simple rows with screenshot uploads, extracted
            details, and quick actions (“create task”, “attach to budget”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeps informal conversations from disappearing while preserving
            simple mental model for users and developers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Direction 4 – AI-Coordinated Planning</h2>
        <p class="meta">
          Chat-based co-pilot tightly wired into events, tasks, vendors, and
          budget.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            AI Planner lives in right rail or full-screen mode with deep links
            into Today, Checklist, Events, Vendors, and Budget.
          </li>
          <li>
            Responses always include structured actions (tasks, notes, changes)
            rather than generic advice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Couples can ask, “What are we missing for Poruwa?” and immediately
            see checklists and tasks updated.
          </li>
        </ul>
